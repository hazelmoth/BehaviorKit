# BehaviorKit

A tiny, easy-to-use .NET behavior tree library.

## Nodes
Behavior trees are built around a concept of Nodes. A Node has an update/tick function, which performs some action and then returns a status of Success, Failure, or Running.

Included are several built-in control nodes, which propagate ticks to their children:
- **Conditional**
- **Sequencer**
- **Repeater**
- **TimeLimit**
- **ImpatientRepeater** (A Repeater that will restart prematurely if its child takes too long.)

Used together, these nodes can facilitate complex logic. There are also a few basic leaf nodes:
- **Execute**, which just executes a given function one time.
- **Wait**, which does nothing for some duration (based on a provided clock).
- **InstantFailer**, which just fails in a single tick (useful for complex control flow).

## Usage
You can construct simple behavior trees with just the included nodes:
```
using BehaviorKit;
using BehaviorKit.Nodes;
public class Agent
{
    private Node node;
    
    public Agent(bool isEvil) {
        node = new Sequencer(
            () => new Execute(
                () => Console.WriteLine("Hello")),
            () => new Conditional(
                () => isEvil,
                () => new Execute(
                    () => Console.WriteLine("How would you like to die today?")),
                () => new Execute(
                    () => Console.WriteLine("You look great today."))));
    }
    
    public void Tick() {
        node.Update();
    }
}
```

For atomic behaviors that last more than one tick, you can define your own nodes. For example:
```
/// A node that outputs a string, one character per tick.
public class ScrollString : Node
{
    private readonly string _str;
    private int _nextChar;

    public ScrollString(string str)
    {
        _str = str;
        _charsLeft = str.Length;
    }

    protected override void Init() { }

    protected override void OnCancel() { }

    protected override Status OnUpdate()
    {
        if (_nextChar < _str.Length) {
            Console.Write(_str[_nextChar]);
            _nextChar++;
        }

        if (_nextChar == _str.Length) {
            Console.WriteLine();
            return Status.Success;
        } else {
            return Status.Running;
        }
    }
}
```

Which can then be used as such:
```
using BehaviorKit;
using BehaviorKit.Nodes;
public class Agent
{
    private Node node;
    
    public Agent(bool isEvil) {
        node = new Sequencer(
            () => new ScrollString("Hello."),
            () => new Conditional(
                () => isEvil,
                () => new ScrollString("How would you like to die today?"),
                () => new ScrollString("You look great today.")));
    }
    
    public void Tick() {
        node.Update();
    }
}
```

You can encapsulate entire trees into their own Node classes to make complex trees more readable. You can also define your very own control nodes.

...That's basically it. Have fun! ðŸ˜‰
